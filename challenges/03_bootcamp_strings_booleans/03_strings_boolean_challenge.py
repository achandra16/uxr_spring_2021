# 1.1 TODO: Let's concatenate the lowercase versions of the employee first and last name in two new variables
# 1.2 TODO: Combine the lowercase first and last name together with a . and save it to a variable joined_names
# 1.3 TODO: We want to add '@ripplemedia.com' to the end of the string inside joined_names and save it in a variable 'emaiil'
# 1.4 TODO: Print out the email using a f string with the message: Your new company email is {email}

#2.5 TODO: Using an f string, convert c_temp to fahrenheit and print out the result formating the two variables inside the string
#Example print statement: 5 degrees celsius is 41.0 degrees fahrenheit
